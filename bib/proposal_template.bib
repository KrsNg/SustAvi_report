	abstract = {Noise in topographic data obscures features and increases error in geomorphic products calculated from {DEMs.} {DEMs} produced by radar remote sensing, such as {SRTM}, are frequently used for geomorphological studies, they often contain speckle noise which may significantly lower the quality of geomorphometric analyses. We introduce here an algorithm that denoises three-dimensional objects while preserving sharp features. It is free to download and simple to use. In this study the algorithm is applied to topographic data (synthetic landscapes, {SRTM}, {TOPSAR)} and the results are compared against using a mean filter, using {LiDAR} data as ground truth for the natural datasets. The level of denoising is controlled by two parameters: the threshold (T) that controls the sharpness of the features to be preserved, and the number of iterations (n) that controls how much the data are changed. The optimum settings depend on the nature of the topography and of the noise to be removed, but are typically in the range T = 0.87-0.99 and n = 1-10. If the threshold is too high, noise is preserved. A lower threshold setting is used where noise is spatially uncorrelated (e.g. {TOPSAR)}, whereas in some other datasets (e.g. {SRTM)}, where filtering of the data during processing has introduced spatial correlation to the noise, higher thresholds can be used. Compared to those filtered to an equivalent level with a mean filter, data smoothed by the denoising algorithm of Sun et al. [Sun, X., Rosin, {P.L.}, Martin, {R.R.}, Langbein, {F.C.}, 2007. Fast and effective feature-preserving mesh denoising. {IEEE} Transactions on Visualisation and Computer Graphics 13, 925-938.] are closer to the original data and to the ground truth. Changes to the data are smaller and less correlated to topographic features. Furthermore, the feature-preserving nature of the algorithm allows significant smoothing to be applied to flat areas of topography while limiting the alterations made in mountainous regions, with clear benefits for geomorphometric analysis in areas of mixed topography. The results of denoising on the derived flow accumulation and slope maps, particularly when compared to the results of mean filtering, demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm in fields such as hydrological modelling and landslide prediction.},

	abstract = {Mapping the transport and deposition of tephra is important for the assessment of the impact of an eruption on health, transport, vegetation and infrastructure, but it is challenging at large distances from a volcano ({\textgreater}1000 km), where it may not be visible to the naked eye. Here we describe a range of methods used to quantify tephra deposition and impact on air quality during the 21-28 May 2011 explosive basaltic eruption of Grimsvotn volcano, Iceland. Tephra was detected in the {UK} with tape-on-paper samples, rainwater samples, rainwater chemistry analysis, pollen slides and air quality measurements. Combined results show that deposition was mainly in Scotland, on 23-25 May. Deposition was patchy, with adjacent locations recording different results. Tape-on-paper samples, collected by volunteer citizen scientists, and giving excellent coverage across the {UK}, showed deposition at latitudes {\textgreater}55 {degreesN}, mainly on 24 May. Rainwater samples contained ash grains mostly 20-30 um long (max recorded grainsize 80 um) with loadings of up to 116 grains cm{\textasciicircum}-2 . Analysis of rainwater chemistry showed high concentrations of dissolved Fe and Al in samples from N Scotland on 24-27 May. Pollen slides recorded small glass shards (3-4 um long) deposited during rainfall on 24-25 May and again on 27 May. Air quality monitoring detected increased particulate matter concentrations in many parts of the country. An hourly concentration of particles {\textless}10 um in diameter ({PM10)}, {\textasciitilde}413 ug m{\textasciicircum}-3 , was measured in Aberdeen at 02:00hrs on 24 May 2011. Significant peaks of non-anthropogenic {PM}, which is most likely to have a volcanic origin, could be tracked as far south as the English Midlands ({\textgreater}53 {degreesN)} on 24 May but no negative effects on health were reported. Although the eruption column reached altitudes of 20 km above sea level, air mass trajectories suggest that only tephra from the lowest 4 km above sea level of the eruption plume was transported to the {UK.} This demonstrates that even low plumes could deliver tephra to the {UK} and suggests that the relative lack of basaltic tephra in the tephrochronological record is not due to transport processes.},

	abstract = {Eruptions of {\"O}r{\ae}faj{\"o}kull have produced mafic and silicic magmas, and have taken place in both glacial and interglacial periods. The geology of the volcano records the differing response of magmas of contrasting composition to interaction with ice of variable thickness and gives insight into the development of a long-lived ice-covered stratovolcano. Vatnafjall, a ridge on the southeast flank of {\"O}r{\ae}faj{\"o}kull, is the first area of the volcano to have been mapped in detail and the geological map is presented here alongside descriptions of each erupted unit. The oldest units comprise pillow lavas, hyaloclastite and jointed lava flows that were formed during subglacial basaltic eruptions involving abundant meltwater. The products of a subsequent explosive, initially phreatomagmatic, subglacial rhyolite eruption were confined by ice to form a tephra pile over 200 m thick that was intruded by dense rhyolite magma towards the end of the eruption. Confinement by ice caused a later trachydacite lava flow to form buttresses and a steep pillar. Whilst some of the meltwater produced infiltrated the lava (to generate red and black glassy breccias and cause localised steam explosions), it is likely that much of it drained down the steep topography. The most recently-erupted units are subaerial basaltic lava flows, the oldest of which were erupted during an interglacial period and have subsequently been partially eroded and scoured by advancing ice. Ice has been important in shaping the edifice by confining eruptive products to form constructional features and by later eroding parts of them to form deep valleys. Reconstructions of volcano-ice interaction allowed the local thickness of the glacier at the time of each eruption to be estimated, and demonstrates that the upper surface of the ice has varied in elevation by over \~{}700 m. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},
